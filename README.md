# Pentatonic-Bricks
### An interactive digital synthesiser based on pentatonic scales

This audio app has been designed for iPad, and features two octaves of the pentatonic scale as it's playing interface. It has been designed with simplicity in mind with a very intuitive user interface, which works well alongside pentatonic scales as these require little to no music theory knowledge to start using.

[Please see this PDF for a very short summary of the design process.](Pentatonic-Bricks_GitHub_info_HD.pdf)
